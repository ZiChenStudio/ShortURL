# 短网址跳转

### 说明

为[zichenstudioweb](https://github.com/ZiChenStudio/zichenstudioweb)的开发和访问提供方便

我们会自动跳转到[https://zichenstudio.netlify.app/](https://zichenstudio.netlify.app/)的界面

即使是子界面也会跳转。

### 使用

访问[https://zcsdev.netlify.app](https://zcsdev.netlify.app)即可。也可以访问对应的子界面，例如[https://zichenstudio.netlify.app/html/all.html](https://zichenstudio.netlify.app/html/all.html)

### 开发者

ZiChenStudio & ZiChen Official Team

> Tips:其实是一个团队。

### 技巧

为了更好的开发，可以访问[https://zcsdev.netlify.app/0107](https://zcsdev.netlify.app/0107)即可避免跳转。

### 更新

因为只是为主开发提供方便，此存储库几乎不会更新。
